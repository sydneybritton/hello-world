Just another repository My name is Sydney and I am 21 years old. I have never used GitHub before, so this is my first experience. I found the Hello-World tutorial easy to follow, and helpful in introducing me to the navigation of the site. This seems helpful because it will allow me to experiment with the code I write before fully changing the master file. Also, I enjoy the feature which allows you to ask someone to review your code.
